    "### Base LLM\n",
    "Models to predict next word based on text training data, large amounts of text data extracted from the internet to obtain a probability based algorithm to generate the next words. For example: if we prompt ```Once upon a time, there was a unicorn``` it could complete it with ```that lived in a magical forest with all her unicon friends``` based on probable following words. But, for instance, we prompt ```What is the capital of France```, it is quite possible that the model will prompt ```What is France's largest city?, What is France's population? What is the currency of France?``` because the articules on the internet often write sets of quizz questions about these topics\n"

    "### Instruction Tuned LLM\n",
    "Here is where a lot of research and momentum in the industry have been directed. It is a model fine-tuned on instructions and good attempts to follow the instructions. In these types of model, if we prompt ```What is the capital of France?```, we will get mostly likely something like ```The capital of France is Paris```. These are basically **Base LLM** trained with large amount of text data that then have been fine-tune with sets of instructions and good attempts to follow these instructions. Often, this is complemented with a technique called **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)** to make the system to more robust to follow instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when working with IT-LLM, we don't obtain the results that we are expecting due to ambiguity in the set of instructions. For example, if we prompt ```Please, write me something about Alan Turing```, it is important to specify if we are expecting something scientific, or about his personal life, his achievemnts, etc. This will give context to the IT-LLM in order to get a better answer for you. We can also specify the tone, do we want the text to be keep casual or we would like to have it as a professional journalist? You could even specify which reference and text they should focus on to carry out the task"
